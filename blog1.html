            <p>Web Development is developing websites and webpages.Web development can be as simple as single static page and can be as complex as an e-commerce website.Three major things u need to know in web development are HTML,CSS,Javascript.
            </p>
            <p>To understand these better, lets take an example of human body, HTML in webpage is similar to the skeleton of human body, CSS in webpage is similar to the makeup we apply and the way we style ourselves, with CSS we make webpages look stylish and JS in webpage is similar to the muscles and nervous system in human body. This provides functionality to web pages.
