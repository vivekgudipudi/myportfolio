            <p>Web Development is developing websites and webpages.Web development can be as simple as single static page and can be as complex as an e-commerce website.Three major things u need to know in web development are HTML,CSS,Javascript.
            </p>
            <p>To understand these better, lets take an example of human body, HTML in webpage is similar to the skeleton of human body, CSS in webpage is similar to the makeup we apply and the way we style ourselves, with CSS we make webpages look stylish and JS in webpage is similar to the muscles and nervous system in human body. This provides functionality to web pages.While talking about web development we come across terms like front end and back end. let's see what those terms mean..
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Front-end</h3>
                Everything you have ever seen on the web is considered ‘front end’. Front end is what we see when we open a web page or app. Code is downloaded from a server and is rendered to the screen by a web browser. What happens when we interact with the code is also considered front end. <br>
                The front end is built out of three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML allows us to put content on our page: text, headers, images, buttons, links, and etc. CSS is used to style our page. It allows the contents to have different text colors, background colors, as well as dealing with the positioning of the content on the page. JavaScript makes our page dynamic. It allows for the content to change on a mouse hover or click and also lets us submit data.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Back-end</h3>
                This term usually refers to what happens behind the scenes - servers, databases, etc. The back end is the place we don’t see as users. This consists of data storage and servers running to provide data for the front end. Back end can be a little harder to imagine, especially for someone without much experience with it. Back end is commonly referred to as the data access layer or server within software development terms. The back end computes the data and content sent to the front end to be used and displayed by your browser. <br>
                Back end server code can be written using JavaScript. However, it can be also written using many other languages, such as C++, Java, or Python. The database logic required in back end development often utilize a database language, such as SQL or MongoDB.
